JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

--------------------
Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

That's why we've been hired! ...  We need to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.

The planet Earth needs to know what we have found!

-----------------
Our Task

    Within the repository for this Javascript challenge, two folders have been created to correspond 
    to the challenges below: UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2.

    The html files have been added to this folder as well as the static folder containing our javascript. 
    This will be the main script to run for analysis.

   
-------------------
UFO Sightings- Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

    Created a basic HTML web page using the index.html file provided.

    Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code 
    that appends a table to our web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
    
    There is a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment. 

    Used a date form in our HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and 
    search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
    
    The user will enter the date they are interested in to search for UFO sightings and click the 
    "Filter Table" button, and any results will display. By refreshing the page, the entire data is 
    once again available for the user to search.
    
----------------------
    
   Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

    In addition to completing all of Level 1 criteria, using multiple input tags and/or 
    select dropdowns we wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and 
    search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
        date/time
        city
        state
        country
        shape
    
    This Level 2 search will utilize the index2.html file within the UFO-Level-2 Folder.
    
    Again, the user will enter the criteria details listed above, and click the "Filter Table" 
    button, and any results will display. the results will display. By refreshing the page, 
    the entire data is  once again available for the user to search.
